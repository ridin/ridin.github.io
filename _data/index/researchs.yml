- name: Approaches of Large-scale Images Recognition with More than 50,000 Categories
  i18n: app
  gh_user: app
  repo: app
  img: /static/assets/img/landing/avatar.jpg
  desc: Applied traditional CV technology, such as feature extraction and processing, BOVW (Bag of Visual Words) and statistical learning techniques, like Mini-Batch K-means, SVM into existing neural network model, to optimize time efficiency and reduce the demand for space within limited resources of PC.

- name: An Improved Helmet Detection Method for YOLOv3 on an Unbalanced Dataset
  i18n: cpython
  gh_user: python
  repo: cpython
  img: /static/assets/img/landing/python.png
  desc: Optimized YOLOv3 on unbalanced data sets. \n\
        Built an image loader, read ordinary .jpg pictures into VOC data set; used Gaussian blur for image enhancement. \n\
        Applied blurred images for neural network training, thus avoiding the impact of data set imbalance.
